# Map Sources
These are meant to serve as a repository for the map sources for MSRebirth. We ask that you follow the license (GPL 3.0) if you plan on using these maps anywhere.

## Directory Structure
* ``prototypes`` - Contains maps that were never released/finished.
* ``map`` - Contains .map files which could be real sources or just decompiled sources?
* ``source`` - Contains map sources. Each map source should be in it's own directory of it's own name.
* ``wads`` - Contains the .wad files that are used by some maps.
* ``testing`` - These are map sources that need to be verified and test.

## Notice
Some of the sources for the map may not compile or crash, please read ``MISSING.md`` to know the maps that may not work. If you find there are any WAD files missing for the maps please let us know at our Discord or by creating a Github issue.

## Credits
A mostly complete list of credits for each map can be found here: https://msrebirth.net/project/maps.html
