Took the spectator entity and placed it in the bandit boss' throne looking into the room.
Added some random bandit NPCs to walk about the room until they're triggered to vanish 
when starting the map (90 seconds to vanish to give time for multiple people to see).

Fixed the bandits sticking together in the ceiling in the cellar room.  Slightly adjusted
their spawns so they aren't close together.  Fell properly on my testing.
